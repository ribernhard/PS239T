A riveting contest of wills has been under way all week as Mayumi Moriyama, a 61-year-old who last August became the first woman appointed Chief Cabinet Secretary, tried to become the first woman to give out a trophy at the end of a sumo wrestling tournament. But an outraged sumo establishment, protecting a tradition as proud as it is naked, let it be known that Mrs. Moriyama would not be welcome to enter the sacred center ring of sumo to present the Prime Minister's Cup at the conclusion of the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo. For 2,000 Years, No Women This evening, Mrs. Moriyama withdrew her request in the face of protests that in 2,000 years no woman had ever been allowed into the 15-foot diameter circular area known as the doyo, where the sumo contest occurs. ''We have to protect our tradition and our culture,'' said Katsuji Tutagoyama, head of the Japan Sumo Association. He added that he did not necessarily favor discrimination against women in all walks of life, but that ''having just one community like this in Japan is O.K.'' For her troubles, Mrs. Moriyama was also reviled by many in Japan as a publicity-seeking busybody who should have known better, and defended by many others as a pioneering spirit in a country where women are almost universally expected to play a subservient role. ''Sumo may be a traditional culture,'' said one supporter, Chizuko Ueno, an associate professor at Kyoto Seikai University. ''But even among our traditional cultures, there are ones we should keep and ones we should change. Sex discrimination is a culture that should not be allowed to exist.'' Target of Press Criticism Mrs. Moriyama, in announcing that she would ''refrain from pressing my claim'' before the sumo establishment, said nonetheless that ''it will be strange if the present situation carries on forever.'' There was no indication of how much support she has within her own Government, including the man who appointed her, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu. Mr. Kaifu had put Mrs. Moriyama in her highly visible position in what was acknowledged as an effort to enhance the fortunes of the Liberal Democratic Party among women. But there was speculation today that Mr. Kaifu had become embarrassed by Mrs. Moriyama's latest efforts. Mrs. Moriyama has been a target of criticism in the press, which has suggested that even though she is the Government's official spokeswoman she is not taking part and sometimes not even informed of major policy initiatives. In sumo, two enormous muscle-bound wrestlers try to push, slap and shove each other out of the clay-floored ring. Their actions are preceded by such ancient rituals as the scattering of salt to purify the ring, squatting to show respect and stamping one's legs to snuff out evil spirits. Recent tradition has called for the Prime Minister's Cup to be presented at the end of each tournament by the Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Government. This time, however, Mrs. Moriyama sought to exercise her privilege to hand out the trophy instead of leaving it to her deputy, striking a blow for feminism. Not Her First Bout With Sexism It was not the first time Mrs. Moriyama tangled with Japan's male establishment, having once sent a letter of protest to a country club when she was barred from attending a golf tournament. Mrs. Moriyama began her career as a civil servant in the Labor Ministry but got involved in politics through her husband, a legislator whose death led to Mrs. Moriyama's running for office. As far back as 1978, when Mrs. Moriyama was still a government bureaucrat, she appealed to the Japan Sumo Association to allow a young girl to compete in a children's sumo contest. The association refused. News articles recalled this week that Mrs. Moriyama asked the Sumo Association what would happen if a woman rose one day to the position of Deputy Cabinet Secretary. Would she be refused entry into the circle to give out a tournament trophy? According to the articles, the reply was that such an eventuality was impossible and unthinkable in Japan."NYT,1990,Romania,EECA,Upheaval in the East; Where Fear and Death Went Forth and Multiplied,"The dictatorship of President Nicolae Ceausescu caused extreme hardships for all but a few hundred thousand of Rumania's 23 million citizens. But in the case of mothers and babies, his rule apparently had the most tragic consequences. Mr. Ceausescu, who was ousted in a popular uprising a month ago, decreed in 1967, two years after he came to power, that Rumania's population, then about 22 million, should increase to 30 million. The reason he gave was simply that he wanted a bigger Rumania - an assertion widely interpreted now as an early indication of his megalomania. And to achieve his goal he banned abortions, made contraception illegal and ordered that Rumanian women of child-bearing age have five children each. No Precise Accounting Harsh fines were ordered for women caught having abortions, and doctors or medical technicians who assisted in abortions were sentenced to up to four years in prison and prohibited from practicing for 10 years. In the latter years of the regime, women working in factories were subjected to pregnancy checks as often as once a week. There is as yet no precise accounting of how many Rumanians were adversely affected by such strictures. Officials of the new provisional Government and outside experts have only begun to gather data about what happened over the years. But the fragmentary figures and educated guesses that they have been able to provide depict a society of families torn by death and fear as a result of the decrees paradoxically meant to make them propagate. ''The policy was a total failure,'' said Dr. Timothy Rutter, a consultant for Murray Stopes International, a British charity that assists planned parenthood projects. Dr. Rutter spent the last week in Bucharest. In talks with officials at the new Government's Ministry of Health, Dr. Rutter was told that while the Rumanian population rate grew by 2.5 percent in 1966, in 1989 there was actually a negative growth rate. Rumanian officials said there were 300,000 births last year and 1.2 million abortions. Jail for Performing Abortions In Iasi, a city of 400,000 people in northern Rumania, physicians told a visitor that three Iasi University medical professors were jailed for one year each under the dictatorship for performing abortions. ''We have many maternal deaths and very many abandoned children'' as a result of the abortion policy, a physician said, adding that in Iasi, medical instruments that might be used in abortions were kept locked up and could be taken out only under the supervision of a state security police officer. Every Rumanian seems to know cases of mothers dying during botched abortions, children orphaned as a result of such deaths and babies harmed by unsuccessful attempts at abortion. Officials said there are 718 orphans up to the age of 3 in Bucharest, many in pitiable condition. The officials said that the children were orphaned as a result of the Ceausescu policies and that there would be more had the regime not sold Rumanian orphans to France for hard currency. Presumably the orphans were from families broken after the mothers had died during abortions or during unhealthy pregnancies. Death of a Wife In an interview, Ion Tudor, a 46-year-old museum worker, told of his family with tears in his eyes. In February 1975, he came home from a work assignment in another city to find his 26-year-old wife, Florica, in a state of collapse. ''She had gotten an abortion from a medical technician,'' he said, adding that he had no knowledge of her plans. ''I called an ambulance. It took 12 hours for the ambulance to arrive. We went to the Giulesti Maternity Hospital. They called the police, who said she could not receive treatment until she confessed who had performed the abortion. She received no care for two days. Then she had a kidney collapse.  ''The doctors sneaked her over to the Emergency Hospital, where the doctors treated her. The doctor there told me if she was strong she had a chance to live. She died 18 days later.'' She left Mr. Tudor with three sons, ages 2, 4 and 5. Mihai Orovanu, a Bucharest photographer, told of visiting an archeological site at Pacuiul Lui Soare, near the Danube, last November and finding a Bucharest physician living in a cave. He had been jailed and then barred from practice for 10 years because he had performed abortions. ''He was living off vegetables he stole from the fields and fish he caught in the river,'' Mr. Orovanu said. 'There Was No Milk' The babies who were born faced severe hardships. Christian Modolciu, a 39-year-old foreign trade specialist who has two children, said he and his wife decided not to have any more. ''We wanted a third child, but there was no milk to be had,'' he said. During the Ceausescu regime, interuterine devices and condoms were traded on the black market, with American-made I.U.D.'s selling for more than $100 apiece. But such devices were scarce. In Bucharest there are 20,000 women in hospitals being treated for abortion complications, Dr. Rutter said, quoting the Rumanian health officials. He said an additional 10,000 Bucharest women are waiting for places in hospitals for treatment of blocked fallopian tubes caused by mishandled abortions. Abortions are being performed at a rate of 60 a day at one Bucharest hospital alone. Condoms are now becoming available in the capital's pharmacies. The first legal decree of the Council of National Salvation, which took power after the fall of Mr. Ceausescus, dissolved the state security police. The second decree was to end the Ceausescu policy banning abortions."NYT,1990,India,Asia,Women in Delhi Angered by Smoking Pitch,"The introduction of a new brand of Indian cigarette aimed at upwardly mobile women has galvanized women's groups and health organizations in India, where anti-smoking campaigns had barely begun. ''It's bad enough they've been selling cancer to men,'' Madhu Kishwar, editor of the women's magazine Manushi, said of the tobacco companies. ''Now they push cigarettes down women's throats in the name of modernity.'' The new cigarette is called Ms. Advertisements for the brand on billboards and in magazines show strong, happy Indian women in Western-style clothes and affluent settings. The Western skirts seem to be symbols of liberation from Indian inhibitions as well as from traditional saris, which women are beginning to discard as too cumbersome for many jobs. The filtered cigarette, described by the makers, Golden Tobacco Company, as especially mild, is the first to take aim at the women's market as Indian women gain more financial and professional independence. ''In India, we've had this strong prejudice against women smoking,'' Miss Kishwar said in an interview. ''This is the first time that they are actually trying to advocate smoking by women and showing it in ads.'' A group of public health workers and medical school professors sent an open letter last week urging newspapers not to accept advertising for Ms. ''This disseminates the evil message that cigarette smoking is part of a healthy and logical way of feminine life,'' the petition said. The health workers described the marketing as ''no less than drug trafficking.'' In the United States, consumer groups have long complained about cigarettes aimed at particular groups, including women. Earlier this year, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, criticized the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for ''deliberately and cynically'' test-marketing a new cigarette brand, Uptown, aimed primarily at blacks. The company withdrew the cigarette. The Indian tobacco industry, protected from most foreign competition, produces about six billion cigarettes a month. There are no figures on how many are smoked by women. U.S. Companies Push Tobacco But marketing experts say that the figure may be higher than most expect and that they are eager to see how many of the Ms. cigarettes will be sold. Miss Kishwar, who is helping to organize a campaign to halt the sale of the brand, said informal surveys showed that many men were buying the new cigarettes out of curiosity. She said most women who smoke do not go out in public to buy cigarettes. Smoking is becoming more widespread in many Asian countries, regional offices of the World Health Organization and other groups say. Asian health professionals are joining protests against United States efforts to break down import barriers for American tobacco companies in countries like India, Thailand and South Korea. The lobbying on behalf of American companies incenses Asians who are trying to establish anti-smoking campaigns and an awareness of the hazards of cigarettes. They complain that as Westerners cut back on smoking, Western tobacco companies are seeking markets abroad. ''Now that there are anti-smoking campaigns in America, they want to dump their cigarettes on us too,'' Miss Kishwar said."NYT,1990,Russia,EECA,Serfdom and 'Soviet Women',"To the Editor: As one of those feminists Ruth Daniloff, in her review of Francine du Plessix Gray's ''Soviet Women,'' anticipated taking umbrage with Ms. Gray's rather worn theory that women desire ''to lead and be led,'' I must say that the only thing paradoxical about the ''paradoxal 'equality' '' Ms. Gray describes is her use of the term to describe a situation that, by her own account, is anything but that. Equally disturbing is the double talk exhibited in Ms. Daniloff's review. For example, ''Paradoxically, men discriminate against women in the Soviet Union, treating them in ways that would horrify their Western sisters. But they do not dominate them. Just the opposite. It is a matriarchy.'' What kind of a matriarchy would pay its female workers ''two-thirds of the average male income,'' give women the ''dirty manual jobs,'' insure that women do not ''reach the top'' of the professions and then blame ''the 'masculinized woman' '' for society's ills? What strange logic allows Ms. Daniloff to say that Russian women are tyrannical while ''Russian men . . . had a heritage of serfdom, followed by more than 70 years of dictatorship that . . . robbed them of initiative,'' as if Russian women had not been subject to the same historical forces? What sort of tyrant would create a world in which, by Ms. Daniloff's own admission, ''the average woman undergoes more than seven abortions in a lifetime'' and ''men refuse to shoulder household responsibilities''? And as to Ms. Gray's ''conclusion that the Soviet Union might be as much in need of a men's movement as of a women's movement,'' I'd say they've had one all along. G. HANLON Boston"NYT,1990,Egypt,MENA,Telling the Seder's Story In the Voice of a Woman,"Twenty-seven women gathered in a downtown loft this weekend for a seder. They celebrated the deliverance of the Jews in Egypt from slavery more than 3,300 years ago, they prayed over the four cups of wine and the matzoh, they ate the ritual foods of bitter herbs and haroseth that symbolize suffering. But when they asked the questions usually posed by the four sons, they asked them as daughters. When they recited the 10 plagues, they were not the plagues inflicted on the Egyptians, but those endured by women through the ages. When they opened the door, it was to welcome not Elijah, but Miriam, the prophet and sister of Moses. The occasion was the annual seder conducted by a group of feminist leaders who call themselves the seder sisters. For 15 years they have interpreted the liturgy to establish women's presence in the Exodus and to make women's voices heard at the Passover table. The seder sisters are Letty Cottin Pogrebin, the writer; Phyllis Chesler, a writer and psychologist; Michele Landsberg, a columnist; E. M. Broner, a writer; Lilly Rivlin, a film maker, and Bea Kreloff and Edith Isaac-Rose, who run an art workshop in Italy. Every year the women invite new guests, but they always include Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug and the writer Grace Paley, whom they call their spiritual leaders. This year, there was not enough room at Ms. Kreloff's and Ms. Isaac-Rose's table, so the white cloth, flowers and ceremonial objects were placed on the floor and the participants sat on pillows around them. Handing Down to Their Daughters As the women begin to hand down the seder to their daughters, including Eve and Liz Abzug and Abigail and Robin Pogrebin, some of their ideas and those of similar groups have been absorbed in conventional family observances. ''This year we have received more phone calls than ever asking where to find an egalitarian Haggadah,'' Susan Weidman Schneider, editor in chief of Lilith, a Jewish women's quarterly, said in a phone interview. The Haggadah is the narrative of the Exodus. The seder sisters conduct their service before Passover so that they can observe the holiday, which begins at sundown tonight, with their families. Asked whether by excluding men, they are perpetuating the separation of women, Ms. Rivlin said: ''That misses the point. We did it so we would hear our own voices, so we could name our own experiences, tell our own story, be the main actors in the retelling of the Exodus story.'' 'Desire to Be at the Center' Ms. Chesler said: ''We are fueled by a longing for Judaism, for religious ritual, as much as by a longing for feminism. We have a great desire to be at the center and to say our own lines.'' So they said their own lines, even as they recited age-old lines. ''Why is this Haggadah different from traditional Haggadoth?'' asks ''The Stolen Legacy, A Women's Haggadah,'' the book that they use. ''Because this Haggadah deals with the exodus of women'' it answers. ''Why have our mothers on this night been bitter? Because they did the preparation but not the ritual. They did the serving but not the conducting. Why on this night do we recline? We recline on this night for the unhurried telling of the legacy of Miriam.'' ''Omission, Absence, Silence'' was the theme of the evening, and Miriam, the sister of Moses, was central. Miriam saved the baby Moses from Pharaoh's edict that all firstborn Jewish sons be killed by putting the baby in the rushes to be discovered by Pharaoh's daughter, who adopted him. Miriam is mentioned in the Torah for dancing at the Red Sea when the Jews passed through. Though scholars now recognize her importance, she was a minor figure in biblical accounts. 'Outsiders in Our Group' Ms. Broner, who was the co-author of the Haggadah and who lead the service, said: ''We read in the Bible that the men of the tribe were forbidden to sleep with the women so they would be pure and fit to receive the Torah. The women only received it secondhand. We also read of the census taken of the tribe. The women are not included in the census; therefore we cannot be part of a consensus. That makes us outsiders in our group.'' ''It is a painful path of women of faith, for one is walking against the wind and one's words are blown back into the mouth,'' she continued. ''We women seem to have little effect on the practice of morality, on the language of the liturgy, on the hierarchical structure of the house of worship. We have two choices in Talmud tradition: to elbow our way into the crowd at the foot of Sinai, to keep bopping up whenever the census taker comes by. Or we can create new ways.'' The women also asked new questions. Ms. Pogrebin told the story of the daughter of Jeptheh from the Book of Judges. Jeptheh, a military leader, promised God that in return for the defeat of the Ammonites, he would sacrifice whatever emerged first from his house upon his return. His daughter came to greet him, sealing her fate. ''I am here to break the silence of Jeptheh's daughter. Now our questions begin,'' Ms. Pogrebin said. ''We ask God, why did you allow an innocent girl to be sacrificed in your name? You stayed Abraham's hand and Isaac lived. Why did you save the son and let the daughter die? Why to this day have you forgotten all the daughters burned by their fathers, neglected, abused, exploited and violated by their fathers?'' Stories of Silences Silences persist, the women said, and as they passed around a cup of water signifying the water of Miriam's well, they told of their experiences with silences. Lisa Gersten, a Barnard College senior, told of the silence of classmates who refuse to call themselves feminists. Ruth W. Messinger, Manhattan Borough President, told of a silence conveyed in words: ''When my mother was born, her mother's mother-in-law said, 'Don't worry, the next one will be a boy.' '' There were flashes of humor. When it was Ms. Abzug's turn to talk about silence, she said, ''This is a tough subject for me.'' Turning serious, she continued. ''I think that somehow my outspokenness has to do with the fact that since childhood I was aware there were things girls were not supposed to do. When I was 13 my father died, leaving no sons or brothers to say Kaddish,'' she said, referring to the mourner's prayer. ''I went to the synagogue and I did it, though I wasn't supposed to. I learned that I could speak out and no one would stop me.'' As the evening drew to a close, the women formed a circle linked by prayer shawls and a chain of fabric pieces that they called the sacred schmatte. Several had taken it on an interfaith mission to Mount Sinai six years ago. ''It reminds us of our connections with our foremothers and all the women whose voices have never been heard on the seder night,'' Ms. Pogrebin said."NYT,1990,Hungary,EECA,Evolution in Europe; Sex Magazines and Massage Parlors Test Hungary's New Limits,"Pornography, long banned by the Communists as the worst spawn of Western decadence, has broken into the open in Hungary, taking its place on the newsstands as another example of a newly emboldened press. But the explosion of sexually explicit material has already produced a backlash. Parents, religious groups and feminists are recoiling from the shock of seeing photographs of nudes and graphic depictions of sexual acts on the covers of publications like Sexexpress, Popo, Sexy Lady, Lesbi Girls, Apollo and the other pornographic magazines prominently displayed at their local kiosks. ''It is no wonder after 40 years of oppression that this profit-oriented business is flourishing,'' said Miklos Hasznos, an official of the Christian Democratic Party. ''Pornography is part of democracy, but human rights means taking the other side into consideration, too.'' The Christian Democratic Party, through its newspaper, Yes, began a campaign against pornography last winter, collecting 90,000 signatures. Distributors have since been required to seal sexually explicit material in clear plastic, but now the campaign has moved on to demands that the magazines be wrapped in brown paper or be otherwise kept from plain sight. ''We are only protesting against the fact that these newsstand pictures are practically yelling out to the 13- and 14-year-olds,'' Mr. Hasznos said. Feminists Are Upset Many here expect Hungary's newly elected Parliament to seek to have the growing sex industry brought under some form of control, with the effort spurred by a coalition of center-right and Christian parties led by the Hungarian Democratic Forum. Feminists, upset by the exploitation of women, worry that controls will be put in place for the wrong reasons. ''I'm very depressed,'' said Judit Revesz, an English teacher active in women's groups. She said the spread of these materials was understandable in light of the years of oppression. ''But what is missing from the debate is the articulation of the view that this is offensive to women,'' she said. ''People are mixing liberty with bad taste.'' Laws regulating sexual mores are now in a state of limbo. This is one reason for the increase in sex shops, sex clubs, sex videos and sex advertisements. Practically everything that can be had in Times Square is now for sale in Hungary. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe In this field, Hungary is either far ahead or, depending on the point of view, far behind all the other Eastern European countries emerging from Communist rule. There is no legal pornography for sale in Romania or Czechoslovakia. In Poland the Roman Catholic Church has waged a successful struggle against the open distribution of such material. But in Hungary, along with the graphic photographs, the magazines - those that print articles - stick to standard fare; an ''objective'' history of the breast appears in an issue of Sexexpress, alongside a historical essay on underwear. There are also articles on AIDS and advertisements for dieting devices. Given this competition, many here say Playboy magazine, which began a Hungarian edition last December, has been surpassed. In Hungary, even more than in other Eastern European countries, a strong consensus exists in support of liberalizing the puritanical code imposed by the Communists. A poll taken last fall by the Hungarian Public Opinion Research Institute showed that 75 percent of those interviewed favored legalizing prostitution, with men and women of an equal mind on the issue. Brothels here were closed in the 1950's, and a public debate is under way on when to allow them to reopen. King of Hungarian Pornography Antal Laszlo Voros, the self-styled king of Hungarian pornography, is not worried about any kind of a clampdown. ''Hungarians have always been more relaxed about sex, and more aggressive about business, than others,'' he said, adding that a petition signed by thousands ''is not enough to stop millions.'' ''I have talked to a lot of members of the Hungarian Democratic Forum,'' Mr. Voros said. ''They are just like us. They like to make love; they like pretty girls.'' Mr. Voros says he refuses to advertise sex with animals, with children, or between men, but otherwise the only limit he sees is what the market in Hungary will bear. ''For five years, it will keep going up and then it will stagnate,'' he said. Mr. Voros, 37 years old, a former journalist, photographer and part-time magician, started with a nudist travel agency and has gone on to create an empire built on pornography. He now operates Budapest's only sex club, publishes six photos-only sex magazines, sells sex tours to Thailand, Greece and other countries, has filmed two pornographic movies and has many more plans - including brothels, a fleet of sex taxis to provide transport for call girls, two sex ships on Lake Balaton in Hungary, and expectations for a pornography export business to Romania, Czechoslovakia and even the Soviet Union if that markets there open up. Boasting of His Success Clearly enjoying his role as kingpin of Hungary's sex business, Mr. Voros likes to boast of his success, even embellish it. Since he went into the business full time a year ago - he still has a car repair and an advertising business on the side - he said he has grossed up to $15 million. Whatever the exact amount, it is apparently enough to build himself a villa with eight rooms and two swimming pools on 10 acres overlooking Budapest, and to make him into one of Hungary's most visibly successful small entrepreneurs. Mr. Voros said the business took off last June when it became clear to him and his contacts at the Ministry of Trade that pornography was no longer off limits. Until then, he had periodically been harassed by the police during filming of his movies, he said. As it is, many of the regular customers of Mr. Voros's sex club - a cramped bar in a backyard in Budapest's Ninth District, decorated with sex paraphernalia and equipped with sauna and massage room in the back - are foreigners, mostly Germans who find the prices in Hungary cheap. The cost of a sex massage is $50 at the official exchange rate. Mr. Voros says he believes that by allowing pornography last summer, the authorities, then still Communist, were making a deliberate effort to siphon off political pressure. ''If we want to be truthful, it was used to take people's attentions from problems - like rising prices,'' he said. ''By giving people pornography, travel and free passports, this was how they tried to cover up for the bad life.'' ''My goal is to have bad conditions,'' Mr. Voros said. ''Then people will spend their sorrow on women and travel.''"NYT,1990,Uganda,Africa,"Buwunga Journal; For the Oppressed Sex, Brave Words to Live By","The women of the village here took a rare break from their afternoon chores, put on their best dresses and walked up to seven miles to come and hear about something revolutionary: women's rights. Under the shade of an ancient mango tree, Sarah Bahalaaliwo, the chairwoman of the Uganda Association of Women Lawyers, spoke about inheritance rights, property rights and divorce law. Don't be fooled, she told the crowd of women seated on the grass. Women can own property. If you inherit land from your father or earn enough to buy some yourself, register it in your own name, not your husband's, she advised. A husband, she said, may try to take all the household possessions during a divorce or separation. ''He might beat you up, but don't give in,'' Mrs. Bahalaaliwo said with a bravado acquired from years of being a lawyer and businesswoman in Kampala, the capital. ''Fight back.'' To this, the women laughed in approval. Sitting on a bench at the edge of the crowd, a group of men who had been invited to sit in smiled nervously. A Tradition of Servility These are words rarely heard in rural areas of Uganda, where, as in many parts of Africa, 14-year-old girls are married off for a dowry of cattle. It is the women, not the men, who do the back-breaking physical labor, lugging enormous containers of water on their heads or on their backs, carrying firewood, digging in the fields, cooking and caring for a multitude of children. In this southern region of Uganda where the Baganda are the dominant people, the submissiveness so common among of African women is compounded by cultural traditions that dictate that a woman kneel when meeting a man, even her own son. The plight of African women and their lack of reward for their overwhelming contribution to food production has prompted numerous calls for reform. Little has changed, but there are signs of new attitudes. For more than a year, a group from the Uganda Association of Women Lawyers has been trying to inform women in the countryside, where 80 percent of Ugandans live, that life doesn't have to be this way. A few months ago, New Vision, the main newspaper in Uganda, ran a cartoon lamenting a woman's life. It showed a woman as an ox, being driven by a husband, whip in hand. A Progressive Government The Ugandan Government of President Yoweri Museveni, struggling to rebuild the war-ravaged country after 20 years of brutality, is one of the most progressive on the continent on the subject of women. Each of the 34 parliamentary districts has an at-large seat reserved for a woman. Women are members of the Cabinet, and the Ministry of Agriculture, one of the most vital posts, is held a woman. But in a male-dominated society where polygamy is common, Mr. Museveni's sentiments are difficult to translate on a broad scale. Thus, the Lawyers Association has found it necessary to publish a leaflet entitled ''Wife-Beating Is Against the Law.'' The leaflet warns women not to believe that it is part of Ugandan custom to accept a beating. It tries to demolish the idea, prevalent among some women, that a woman is beaten as a sign of love. ''In traditional societies a woman was treated with great respect and beating a woman was despised,'' the leaflet says.  AIDS Epidemic a Factor Reflecting the devastation that AIDS is causing in Uganda, particularly in this southern district of Masaka, where Buwunga is located, many of the questions at the lawyers meetings are about the social consequences of the disease. Indeed, the local women explained that the turnout at the meeting under the tree was low because many women were attending one of the half-dozen funerals held that day, and most days, for AIDS victims in the area. ''If you advise your husband to use a condom, he may beat you and send you away,'' a rural woman asked. ''Where do you go?'' ''Take life into your own hands,'' a lawyer, Dora Kanabahita, responded. ''You have a brain. You've got hands. Don't rely on the man to provide for you.'' A man from the bench on the sidelines rose and asked a question. Traditionally, he said, men married as many women as possible, but these days the practice encouraged the spread of AIDS. What should men do? Fatalism and Separatism Mrs. Bagalaaliwo suggested that now was the time to ask whether the practice of multiple marriages is a good idea. Anyway, she informed the questioner, a new law aimed at curbing the spread of AIDS was about to be debated in Parliament. If passed, it would send a man to jail for life if he had sex with a girl under 15. One of the consequences of the AIDS epidemic is that men are seeking ever-younger sexual partners in hopes that the girls have not yet been exposed to the disease. A fragile woman expressed what appeared to be a widespread fatalism about AIDS. ''We realize our men have AIDS after it is too late, so we live normally with them because we know we are going to die,'' she said. Such behavior, Mrs. Bagalaaliwo cautioned, is not responsible. Later, out of earshot from her class, she said, ''Women are really scared of AIDS.'' They know, she added, that when a woman is no longer able to have children, the men will turn to a younger woman anyway. ''So now some of the women were asking, 'Why don't we just live alone?' '' In Ugandan society, that is a truly revolutionary idea."NYT,1990,Kenya,Africa,Puberty Rite for Girls Is Bitter Issue Across Africa,"In the sprawling cattle country of southwestern Kenya, a 12-year-old girl walked bravely along a dirt track, swathed in a brightly colored cloth and carrying an open black umbrella. Shilling notes dangled from her headgear, framing her face, as village people dressed in tree branches clapped and sang to her. The girl had just been circumcised in a ceremonial rite of passage of the Kuria tribe. A local woman was paid about $6 to perform the procedure, in which the girl's clitoris was cut with a knife or razor. There was no anesthetic. The circumcision of women, traditionally a means of guarding virginity or discouraging sexual intercourse outside marriage, is common in more than 20 African countries. In some societies, the operation involves slitting the hood of the clitoris; in others, the clitoris is completely excised and the sides of the vulva are stitched together, a process known as infibulation. Reports from the United Nations suggest that the practice affects 20 million to 70 million women. Statistics are unreliable because the procedure is often performed clandestinely, usually by a local woman with no formal training. Infection, Perhaps Death The operation can have severe consequences. It limits a woman's ability to enjoy sex and can result in bleeding and lead to tetanus and other infections, including damage to the fallopian tubes, which can cause infertility. Deaths are not uncommon.  Practiced among Muslims, Christians and animists, the tradition of circumcising women dates to the Phoenicians in the fifth century. For 10 years now, groups of African and European women, often under the banner of the United Nations, have been campaigning to end the ritual. To advance their cause, they have emphasized the medical hazards rather than the moral issues. But progress toward ending the practice has been slow. In the Sudan, for example, the procedure remains common. Last year, a woman in her mid-20's from an educated family told a Western friend that she would undergo the operation on her own, even though her family had decided against having her circumcised. She said she felt that her fiance wished her to undergo the procedure. In Somalia, the circumcision of women is widely practiced outside the cities. Educated women, including the elite who have attended universities abroad, still feel pressure to have their daughters circumcised, not so much from men as from their mothers and grandmothers. Pressure From Older Women ''The older women still feel young girls are never going to get married unless they are circumcised,'' said Raakiya Omaar, a Somali who heads Africa Watch, a London-based human-rights organization. ''It's very much the wife having to fight her mother or his mother not to have it done.'' The recent ceremony of the Kuria tribe, in which a number of girls were circumcised, prompted President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya to reiterate his opposition to the practice. His predecessor, Jomo Kenyatta, had endorsed circumcision of women as a form of nationalist resistance to colonial interference. Mr. Moi is one of the few African heads of state to oppose the practice publicly, a stand he repeated in early January. Apparently feeling secure enough to withstand a traditionalist backlash, he outlawed the circumcision of women soon after he came to power in 1982. Other leaders who have spoken against the practice are Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso, who was deposed and executed in October, and Abdou Diouf of Senegal. Laws Accomplish Little But laws against circumcising women have had little effect on long-held customs. ''It is one of the practices that will die, but it will take time,'' said Joyce Naisho, a nurse with the African Medical and Research Foundation. The influence of Christianity and wider education has helped curb the practice in Kenya, she said. Yet the Masai, the tribe to which Mrs. Naisho belongs, and the Kalenjin, the people of President Moi, are among the groups that still practice the removal of the clitoris, she said. Among the Masai, circumcision marks a girl's passage to adulthood. ''Once a girl starts menstruating, they consider circumcision,'' Mrs. Naisho said. Usually, she said, a midwife or a woman who specializes in circumcising women takes the girl to the nearest river very early in the morning, when the water is at its coldest. The cold water helps to arrest the bleeding. A homemade razor blade is used to cut the clitoris. For two or three years after the procedure, the Masai girls abstain from sexual intercourse, Mrs. Naisho said. Then they are ''shaved, cleansed and given away to marriage.'' 'Ready for Marriage' The social pressure to be circumcised is often overwhelming. Nelson Monanka, a 44-year-old farmer of the Kuria tribe, had his three daughters circumcised several weeks ago. ''Customs demand that they be circumcised at this stage to fit in the community,'' he said. ''They are also happy to be among the well-respected women here. ''There is no way girls can command respect here if they are not circumcised and ready for marriage,'' he said. Mr. Monanka's house was one of many flying flags to show that a member of the family had been circumcised. The number of deaths from the procedure is not known in Kenya because the practice is largely covert. Mr. Moi banned the procedure after learning that 14 girls died and 9 others were taken to hospitals in critical condition after being circumcised. Many Painful Operations The more extreme form of circumcision, infibulation, which is also called Pharaonic circumcision, is practiced in the Sudan, Somalia and Nigeria. It is usually performed on younger girls, from age 3 to about ages 6 or 7, and has far more serious effects. Many women undergo a painful series of de-circumcisions and re-circumcisions after each childbirth. Scars from circumcisions are cut open before delivery and stitched together afterward. This causes severe hemorrhaging, prolongs delivery and increases the risk of fetal brain damage. Girls are subjected to the more extreme procedure at a young age so that they will be unable to have sexual intercourse before marriage, said Awa Thiam, a researcher at the Department of Cultural Anthropology at the University of Dakar in Senegal. ''The girl who has been infibulated cannot have relations with a man before her de-infibulation, which in principle takes place only on the day the marriage is consummated and which is terribly painful,'' Dr. Thiam wrote in a paper for the United Nations Scientific and Educational Organization. In the Sudan, this extreme form of circumcision is viewed as a way of preserving a girl's virginity and discouraging immorality. Excising the sensitive parts of the genitalia decreases sexual sensation, and the smaller vaginal opening makes penetration painful, leaving the girl fearful of sexual intercourse. Many women in the Sudan and in other African societies accept circumcision because they are taught to believe that sexual pleasure is the exclusive right of men. A Quandary for Doctors Such wide acceptance of the procedure poses an ethical quandary for qualified doctors working in hospitals. In Nairobi and in rural Kenyan centers with small hospitals, parents approach doctors and ask them to perform hygienic circumcisions. The parents say they will take their daughters to local midwives if the doctors refuse. ''It is completely against medical ethics and I have refused to do it,'' said Dr. Zolia Lyco, an obstetrician who has worked in Nigeria and Kenya. ''At some mission hospitals where they see a lot of damage done by local people, I think they'd do it.'' Like many African women, Grace Ogot, Assistant Minister for Culture and Social Services in Kenya, wants to see an end to circumcision of women. She joined President Moi last week in condemning the practice, saying that it leaves ''permanent mental and physical trauma which at a later date in adulthood results in injurious childbirth to both mother and child.'' But arguments that the circumcision of women is a means of gratifying men and denying women pleasure are often detrimental here, many say. ''It is such a long, embedded social tradition that if Western people say, 'this is barbaric,' it backfires,'' said Miss Omaar, the Somali who heads Africa Watch. ''Emphasis must be put on the medical aspects, not on the sexual issues.''"NYT,1990,Egypt,MENA,Cairo Journal; For Women Only: A Train Car Safe From Men,"When the idea was first put into effect on Cairo's rapid transit system, some said it would mean the creation of a kind of harem on wheels. Others said it just wouldn't work. But, two months later, according to the authorities, a plan to set aside one car on each train in the subway solely for women is making notable gains in protecting women from one of Cairo's unrelenting perils, sexual harassment of women by men on overcrowded public transport. Built in the late 1980's at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars, the Cairo subway is one of the city's few obvious success stories: it works, it is generally clean and it is quiet - attributes not usually associated with the Egyptian capital, or with rapid transit in many other places. ''It is a sign of civilization, and matchless in the Middle East,'' proclaimed The Egyptian Gazette, an English-language paper. Indeed, the system, which runs from north to south, mostly above ground although it ducks briefly below the city center, is said to be the only one of its kind in the Middle East and all Africa. City of Traffic Torment The line was opened in 1987, linking three miles of subway to existing above-ground tracks, part of a project designed to provide a 26-mile link along the East Bank of the Nile. Created largely with French aid, it has cost $370 million so far. By the time it is complete, the whole project should cost $560 million. Its first years in operation, however, have been ambiguous. In impoverished Egypt, the 10-cent fare for an average inner-city ride is roughly three times the bus fare. And, while it offers passengers much speedier transit, it has not yet noticeably achieved its aim of drastically reducing traffic above ground, which continues in a state of permanent tangle. When the subway opened, it was estimated that each day a half million cars, cabs and minibuses competed above ground with 2,300 buses and a tram line for space on streets filled with millions of pedestrians in the largest city to be found in Africa or the Middle East. The subway was supposed to reduce above ground traffic by 75 percent. Since then, however, traffic congestion has gotten worse, even though the subway carries an estimated 20,000 commuters in each direction every hour from early morning until late at night. And it is guarded by a special police unit that keeps the stations free of litter-droppers, muggers, vandals or scrawlers of graffiti. The Place of Women Lately, the subway police have assumed another task: telling men not to board the first car of any train. The segregation of the subway cars is part of a larger issue about the difficult position of those Egyptians who seek a new status for women in a society that is being pushed toward an older doctrine of female subservience by a revival of Islamic fervor. ''Nasser gave women the vote'' in 1956, said Mona Makram-Ebeid, a senior member of the opposition Wafd party. ''Now, with this obscurantist movement, women are keen on keeping what advantages they have.'' ''The Islamic movement makes the accusation that women are invading public space and should be at home with their children,'' she said. ''It argues that the women's place is not in public life, not to be seen but to be a specator.'' The Debate Rages Such complaints are becoming increasingly frequent among well-educated women, responding to male assertions that women going to work are a prime source of congestion on public transport and joblessness among men. But the segregated subway cars offer a more abstract issue: to what extent should women be given greater rights than men to protect them from male misbehavior in what is still a male-dominated society. ''Since women have called for equality with men in all spheres of life, it is natural that she should fight like him for an empty seat,'' The Egyptian Gazette said in an article setting out the debate. Thuraya Labna, a feminist member of the Egyptian Parliament, who is credited with first proposing the idea of a segregated car, maintained that levels of sexual harassment were so high on public transport that women needed safe places to travel. Return to Segregation? But that drew a response from another commentator in The Egyptian Gazette, who said segregation in subway cars ''pulls us back to the dark ages of segregation and even humiliates our women, treating them as weak and subordinate.'' Down below ground, the verdict, apparently, is not yet in. As a train drew into a station in Cairo's city center recently, a newswoman joined the women in the segregated car, and took a sampling of opinion. ''I think it is a very nice idea,'' said a woman in the distinctive attire of rural Egypt. ''But we were never harassed on the Metro like we were on the buses.'' The buses, where travelers have as much space as sardines in a can, are much cheaper than the subway, but riding them can be very unpleasant, many women say. A friend then contributed to the debate, saying that the trains stop at each station for such a brief period that the most any passenger, male or female, can hope to do is to scramble for a seat, in whatever car is available. Complaints From Men Then, a male reporter took a sampling in one of the eight non-segregated cars. Maybe it was fine for unaccompanied daughters and wives to be protected, some men said. But how come, the reporter was asked, men couldn't use the segregated car - even when it was empty - and had to cram into the other non-segregated cars while women could use any of them? Mohammed Mabrouk Abu el Einin, the subway's Head of Operations, had his own views. ''We are the ones who initiated the idea of seeking the comfort of our women, and I think we were right,'' he said. ''I think the idea is a success. You can go down the Metro and see that the women's cars are always full of women. I think the percentage of success is about 90 per cent,'' he continued. ''What is said about a harem on wheels is not true. We only seek the comfort of our daughters and wives.''"NYT,1990,India,Asia,WOMEN HARASSED ON TOURS IN ASIA,"Harassment of Western women traveling in South Asia has turned increasingly violent, marring their vacations and undermining efforts by several countries to cash in on a recent boom in beach vacations, diplomats and tourists say. South India, particularly the Kovalam Beach area near this capital of Kerala state, hopes to expand or develop seaside vacation areas for foreign tourists as a quick way of earning hard currency. Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and to some extent, Pakistan, are making similar efforts after witnessing the success of countries further east, such as Thailand and Malaysia. In all of these areas, diplomats and tourism officials say, problems have developed as self-confident European and North American women, often traveling alone, encounter rural male societies with no understanding of Western behavior.  'The Wrong Signals' In South Asia, where women rarely venture out alone on vacations, and usually bathe in the sea fully dressed and in groups - if at all - friendly foreigners in skimpy clothes ''give all the wrong signals,'' a Western diplomat said. The diplomat recently dealt with a rape case after three young women accepted an invitation to dinner at a Sri Lankan fisherman's home. As the New Year holidays were ending here in the southern state of Kerala, a leading newspaper reported that many Western women had filed complaints with the local tourism authorities about harassment by men. The report, in The Times of India, said some women had been touched in an intimate way or otherwise molested, often with lewd suggestions, as they traveled on boats along Kerala's inland waterways on trips advertised abroad by the state Tourism Department. Some women had to endure such treatment for hours, with other passengers failing to intercede. In one case, a young European woman threw herself into the sea, the newspaper said, when she was attacked on a beach by a mob of young men. Other tourists saved her from drowning. Indian Women Fight Back Indian women often encounter such behavior while traveling alone on buses or trains. They are beginning to fight back, sometimes with the help of other passengers. Indians and other South Asians say that foreigners are often slow to recognize signals of an impending assault, or are too stunned to respond quickly. Cultural differences related to religion can also lead to conflict between tourists and local residents. The Maldives, an Islamic nation, has responded by isolating the tourists on small islands, where they have very little contact with local people. In Bangladesh, an Islamic nation that is trying to develop the Cox's Bazaar area on the Bay of Bengal, some tourist beaches have been fenced off with barbed wire to keep leering crowds away. Foreign residents of Dhaka, the nation's capital, say it is difficult to relax and enjoy beach life in a society that rejects such behavior as immoral and provocative. In Pakistan, tourism officials acknowledge that it will be difficult to revive plans to build resorts on the Arabian Sea because of strong opposition from the Islamic leadership."NYT,1990,Germany,West,"UPHEAVAL IN THE EAST: East Germany; At House of Democracy, Some Pluralism for Berlin","A single building, a solid five-story structure from the days of the last Kaiser, houses more political groupings today than this capital has known since Hitler came to power 57 years ago. A modest handwritten cardboard sign at the entrance names it the ''House of Democracy.'' It is the headquarters for most of the new parties and movements that will take part in elections on March 18, striving to seal the demise of the Communists, who ruled East Germany without opposition until last fall's peaceful popular rising. Until last month, the house was the headquarters of the Communist Party for the center of East Berlin. The party vacated the building in response to opposition demands for equality of chances in the voting for East Germany's first freely elected Parliament. Now, Democratic Reawakening, which describes itself as a conservative party, shares the house at 165 Friedrichstrasse with the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, whose leaders do not bridle at the label of ''anarchists'' (although they say they wouldn't choose it for themselves) and the United Left, which puts itself left of the Communists. Green Party and Green League The Green Party keeps house next to the Green League, which refuses to become a party, and the Citizens Movement Democracy Now, which fuses Christian and Socialist ideas. Another group, the Independent Association of Women, unites women of many political tendencies who have put their differenes temporarily aside to unite for the defense of women's rights. A day inside shows the joys and growing pains of an infant democracy and its parents. The corridors swarm with people, mainly young, who want to join the movement, or at least pick up some of their mimeographed literature or ask them to send speakers to speak about the ideas they represent. Any door a visitor opens leads to men and women in deep discussion. Sometimes the subject is organization, because all the parties and movements are still in gestation; sometimes the conversation cuts across party lines, as representatives of different groups talk about election coalitions. But all doors appear to be open, and none seems to lead to the smoke-filled rooms of older democracies. Two Parties Stand Aside Only two of the new movements stand aside from this marketplace of the new politics. At separate headquarters are the Social Democrats, who in the consensus of the other parties have received so much assistance from their West German patrons that they feel sure they will emerge as the strongest party, and the New Forum, which was the most prominent organization in bringing about the downfall of the Communists but plans not to present candidates. Despite the multiplicity of views, most of the organizations in 165 Friedrichstrasse are on speaking terms. They agree on one issue: none seem to want to speak to Democratic Reawakening, which is said to be receiving almost as much help from the West German Christian Democrats as the Social Democrats get from their Western partners. ''They have climbed on Kohl's lap and got their candy for it,'' says Vera Wollenberger, a leader of the Green Party, speaking of the group's links to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party. 'They Are Swallowing Us' Throughout the building, a feeling prevails that the Social Democrats and Democratic Reawakening, are not only like their West German counterparts but also the principal mechanisms for rapid reunification of the two states. Leaders speaking for the other groups unanimously expressed concern over what they consider the greatly quickening pace toward formation of a single Germany, entirely on West German terms. ''They are swallowing us,'' is a phrase that sooner or later turns up in conversations throughout the day's chats in offices and corridors. ''It may be going too fast,'' conceded Erhard Neubert, a theologian, sociologist and former evangelical pastor, who is deputy chairman of Democratic Reawakening. ''Unity will come de facto by public pressure.'' Mr. Neubert said he and others had hopes before the public pressure grew for reunification that the first three parliamentary votings would be contested by a coalition of all non-Communist forces against the ruling party. He said such a parliament would have been best able to deal with issues specific to a country that developed separately from the other Germany. Interest From West Germany ''It has become impossible because of the massive West German intervention,'' he said. ''Now we have to orient ourselves along the West German political spectrum. Our own problems will receive short shrift. We cannot put the brakes on this process, but we must try to steer and shape it.'' Above all, Mr. Neubert said, the first non-Communist East German Government must control the influx of West German capital and see to it that the bulk goes to smaller enterprises and leads to the creation of a middle class in this largely egalitarian country. But Mr. Neubert said that not only was his party accepting material help from its West German sympathizers -as other groups do also in varying degrees - but also the services of 15 to 20 West Germans who cross daily. ''We don't have organizational experience to build a party structure,'' he said. ''But we try to do all we can ourselves.'' ''Of course, somebody from the East could do what I do,'' said Sven Leistikow, a West Berlin student volunteer. ''But somehow they are not here.''"NYT,1990,Iran,MENA,"Safiyeh Firouz, Iranian Princess, 87","Princess Safiyeh Firouz, a member of the Iranian royal family deposed in the 1920's, died of a heart attack on Tuesday. She was 87 years old and lived here in exile. She was the widow of Prince Mozaffar Firouz, whose grandfather, King Mozaffar ud-Din Shah of the Qajar dynasty, was overthrown by the father of the late Shah Mohammed Riza Pahlevi in 1925. Prince Firouz died in 1983. Princess Firouz was an early advocate of women's rights. She led a march on the Iranian Parliament for women's suffrage in the 1940's and opposed wearing the chador. In 1943, she founded the Council of Women in Iran. She is survived by two sons, Eskander and Narcy, and five grandchildren. Because of an editing error, an obituary last Thursday about Princess Safiyeh Firouz, a member of a deposed Iranian royal family, misidentified her late husband. He was Prince Mohammed Hussein Mirza Firouz. The article also misstated the historical role of her husband's grandfather, Mozaffar ud-Din Shah. He was an earlier ruler, not the one who was overthrown in the 1920's."NYT,1990,Belgium,West,Belgium Eases Its Abortion Law,"Overcoming 17 years of opposition by Christian Democratic parties, the Belgian Parliament approved a law this afternoon that would allow abortions in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy for women ''in a state of distress.'' The law annulled a section of the penal code dating from 1867 that barred all abortions. Until today, Ireland and Belgium had been the only countries in Europe maintaining a complete legal ban on abortions. In the last 17 years, at least 15 attempts to overturn the Belgian law had failed in Parliament. The vote in the national legislature today was 126 for the new law, 69 against and 12 abstentions. The Socialists, Liberals and Greens largely voted for the change while the Christian Democrats and Flemish nationalists voted solidly against or abstained. In the current Parliament, elected in December 1987, there are 72 Socialists, 62 Christian Democrats, 48 Liberals and 9 Greens, with the rest divided among minor parties. All major parties are separated into French-language and Flemish-language organizations. The Government of Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, a Flemish Christian Democrat, is a coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists and Flemish nationalists. Avoided Confrontation Rather than endanger the coalition, Mr. Martens and his party backed away from confrontation and left the matter to individual conscience. The Christian Democrats had previously blocked pro-abortion legislation by threatening to bring down the Government by breaking the coalition. The Christian Democrats in Belgium, particularly in Flanders, are traditionally close to the Roman Catholic Church. Most estimates say at least 90 percent of Belgium's 9.87 million people are Roman Catholics. The bill must also be signed by the King, Baudouin I. Under the new law, the determination of a pregnant woman's ''state of distress'' will be left to the woman herself and her doctor. Women must be counseled on alternatives and be given at least six days to reach a decision. After 12 weeks of pregnancy, abortion is legal only if two doctors agree that the woman's health is in danger."NYT,1991,Japan,Asia,Patterns,"As one watches the schoolchildren streaming in and out of the Polo/Ralph Lauren shop here in the fashionable Harajuku section, it is easy to see why the biggest designer name in Japan is ''Raruf Rohren.'' R's and l's do not roll off the Japanese tongue, but Ralph Lauren's look comes quite naturally to young people here. Generally, Japanese schools require uniforms: for the boys, black or navy blue military tunics; for the girls, little sailor jackets and pleated skirts in Black Watch plaid. They look an awful lot like the military styles Mr. Lauren designed for his current spring collection. And the contents of the store - from the cricket bats and antique Rolexes to the argyle golf clothes and tweedy salespeople (who, thank goodness, are not tall, frightening blondes) - all seem to fit nicely with the strong traditional streak in Japanese fashion. The Japanese call it ''trad.'' Mr. Lauren's styles are manufactured in Japan through a licensing arrangement with Seibu, the department store chain, whose executives estimate the annual sales volume to be about $200 million. Nowadays nearly every designer in the world has a Japanese business partner. Takashimaya Ltd., with 17 department stores throughout Japan, holds licenses for Geoffrey Beene, Romeo Gigli, Thierry Mugler and Emanuel Ungaro clothes. Isetan Company Ltd., with five stores in the Tokyo area, has the licenses for Calvin Klein and Adrienne Vittadini. Mitsukoshi has Oscar de la Renta. This doesn't mean, however, that the Japanese can buy only Lauren in Seibu, Klein at Isetan or Beene at Takashimaya. The stores sell to each other. As a Takashimaya executive put it, ''It's as if Macy's were wholesaling to Bloomingdale's.'' Historically, the licensing of Japanese manufacturers has been necessary to modify the styles to suit the different body sizes of the Japanese customer, as well as to guarantee selling space in the arcane world of Japanese retailing. But all this may be changing. As Japanese women become more well-traveled and sophisticated, they are no longer satisfied with the licensed designs. They want the real thing. But there's a drawback. With the yen down as much as 30 percent in recent weeks, the cost of directly imported apparel could test the pocketbook of the most determined Japanese consumer. A Double Standard For all its apparent dynamism relative to the West, the Japanese fashion business is not without its social costs. A female executive at a Japanese licensee of French clothing said that although fashion is considered a promising field for women in Japan, she had been frustrated by a lack of advancement and equal pay. Female employees at most Japanese department stores wear uniforms, not just on the sales floors but in the merchandising offices upstairs. Aside from their jackets and ties, men at similar levels do not. The imposition of standardized dress, usually an olive drab jumper with a striped cotton blouse, instantly signifies a subordinate role to a visitor. ''In Japan there is a world for men and a world for women within a company,'' said a female executive of a large Tokyo department store who asked not to be identified. ''To go up the corporate ladder, you need to engage in politics, and women here are not as political.'' The issue befuddles Japanese fashion executives. ''We are trying to put more emphasis on women,'' said Teruhiro Kagamihara, an associate director of the Takashimaya chain. ''But if women are allowed to wear their personal clothes, they would have to spend much more money on their wardrobes.'' A female executive from a large Tokyo fashion house who has worked in the United States and who did not want to be named said: ''We are, of course, measuring the social price by American standards. But this is just normal here. It's what Japanese call 'shoganai,' 'it can't be helped.' '' Synthetic Fashions While oddly shaped Japanese creations have become familiar and have been co-opted by the fashion mainstream, Japanese designers continue to be in the vanguard of fabric development. Japanese textile manufacturers have come up with fibers for hosiery and slippers that emit fragrance, skiwear that uses solar energy for warmth, and an artificial silk made from milk. At the designer level, such innovation is sometimes easy to overlook. At the Comme des Garcons show, held in an atmosphere of massive overstatement at the Jingu Pool, a vast indoor space with a mechanical ceiling that rumbled open to admit the hazy sun's rays just as the first model came down the runway, the fabrics were the story. Among the very odd styles were billowing coats and dresses, including big puffy white bridal dress made of a thick batting material. It looked like insulation. It was. ''The whole inspiration for the collection was quilted synthetic fabric,'' said Rei Kawakubo, the designer who is president of Comme des Garcons. She was wearing one of her shiny black jackets made of enameled vinyl to resemble patent leather. Assistants scurried about in black Lucite vests, which jangled around like high-tech chain mail. In the same collection, she showed long dresses in a velvet that looked as though it were lighted from within. It was actually rayon and polyester, dyed separately, to create the radiant effect. ''My purpose,'' Ms. Kawakubo said, ''is to be different.''"NYT,1991,France,West,Frenchwomen Just Ignore the Harassment,"To the Editor: Apropos the ''French in Action'' learning program discussed in ''French Course, Termed Sexist, Will Be Revised'' (Campus Life, April 15; National Edition, April 16), particularly the episode of Jean-Pierre harassing Mireille, whose response is to walk away: As a Frenchwoman with some experience of this annoying national sex game, called ''la drague,'' I would like to add that the learned response of Frenchwomen to harassers in public places is to ignore them. Any answer is perceived as potential encouragement. Most Frenchwomen avoid resorting to insults, whose sexual and scatological implications have on Frenchmen the effect of a turn-on. To walk away is in itself an insult and is perceived as such by the dragueur, who will usually vent his frustration by cursing briefly and walking away himself. (The clever ones apologize.) The dragueur rarely insists. La drague always takes place in public places, with potential spectators. Because any average-looking young woman sightseeing in France can find herself in this situation three or four times a day, American women should know how their French counterparts deal with the problem, whether they approve the method or not. For the unprepared, the experience can be miserable. ANNE-MARIE DE GRAZIA New York, April 19, 1990"NYT,1991,Haiti,LA,COMMENCEMENT; Women Lauded at Barnard,"Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont told Barnard College's graduating class yesterday that women are, as never before, poised to play a greater role in world politics, the environment and the economy. ''Today, in the post-Cold War era, we may be entering a more propitious time, when female leaders, with their credentials, may not only be viewed as equally qualified, but may emerge with greater credibility, compared to traditional warrior leaders.'' She welcomed the ascendance of Violeta Chamorro in Nicaragua and, ''possibly,'' Ertha Pascal-Trouillot in Haiti. Her caution regarding Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot appeared to reflect reports that the new President of Haiti has been unable to effect positive change there. ''In the post-Cold War era,'' Governor Kunin added, ''military experience, skill in warfare, is no longer a prerequisite for political power.'' Bouquets of Flowers It was the 98th commencement of Barnard, a women's college affiliated with Columbia University. The college conferred degrees on 511 undergraduates. Both Governor Kunin and Barnard's president, Ellen V. Futter, spoke to the graduates about feminism and what the Governor called ''the historic tension that exists for women between fulfilling the female role and fulfilling our roles as contributing and equal members in society.'' The Governor, a mother of four, said, ''My experience in seeking child care, juggling schedules, coping with many of the conflicts of family and career, has had a profound effect on my political agenda.'' And she chided President Bush for planning to veto a family-leave bill before Congress that would permit both men and women up to three months of unpaid time off from their jobs to care for newborn or adopted children or ailing relatives."NYT,1991,Japan,Asia,Tokyo Official Ties Birth Decline to Education,"One of Japan's most powerful politicians, Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, told the Cabinet this week that the reason for an alarming decline in the country's birth rate is the Government's policy of encouraging Japanese women to obtain a higher education. Mr. Hashimoto's commments, reported over the last two days by Government officials and the Japanese press, appeared to suggest that Japan should take strong policy measures -perhaps including steps that would discourage women from continuing their education - to assure that Japan has a sufficient work force to meet its economic growth plans in the next century. According to Government studies, Japan's birth rate fell to an all-time low last year of 1.57 children per woman. In 1988, the rate was 1.66. Mr. Hashimoto's comments prompted a somewhat embarrassed flurry of statements from the Government's chief spokesman, Misoji Sakamoto, who at first suggested that the Finance Minister was expressing Japan's official view of how to reverse the low population growth trend, and then backed away from the comments. ''It is not such an easy matter to get Japanese women to bear children for us,'' Mr. Sakamoto said. Mr. Hashimoto's statement received a rather muted response here, perhaps because Japanese society still broadly expects women to put child rearing ahead of most other concerns. But his comments created enough of a stir that late today he issued another statement. ''Since Japan's birth rate has been recently decreasing, I talked about a possible review of the higher education system,'' he said through Jun Shiozaki, director general of Japan's Management and Coordination Agency. ''But I didn't mean to say that the pursuit of higher learning by women is related to the drop in the birthrate.'' Mr. Shiozaki, who had conveyed Mr. Hashimoto's original remarks, said he must have misinterpreted the Finance Minister's statement, and apologized ''for the trouble I have caused.'' Mr. Hashimoto's observations were widely reported, and cast as another example of the governing Liberal Democratic Party's continuing troubles with women who vote, who make up much of the support for Japan's opposition parties. Earlier this year, during a strenuously contested election campaign, a prominent member of the Liberal Democratic Party suggested publicly that voters should be suspicious of Takako Doi, leader of the Japan Socialist Party, because she is unmarried and has no children. The comment immediately drew harsh criticism, though Miss Doi's party did not fare as well as it had hoped in the election. But the Socialist victory in an election last summer for control of the upper house of Parliament was attributed in part to the growing solidarity of women, who were angered by a new Government sales tax and by a sex scandal that forced the ouster of Prime Minister Sousuke Uno after two months in office. Mr. Hashimoto, a political ally of former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, is frequently mentioned as a strong candidate to become Prime Minister in the next few years. But he is known for controversial statements, especially by Japan's demure standards. A month ago, he was forced to backtrack on suggestions that Japan should resume its aid to China before other Western allies agree to take the same step. Few experts dispute Mr. Hashimoto's basic observation: that a growing number of Japanese women have delayed beginning families so that they can complete their education. Today more than a third of all Japanese women go to a two-year or four-year college. Twenty years ago, only about 17 percent went to a college of any kind. Until now, no one has publicly suggested policies that would discourage women from attending college. ''Higher education, if we consider including women, is contributing to lowering the birth rate,'' Mr. Hashimoto was reported to have said. ''I want the Government to study this point.''"NYT,1991,Japan,Asia,Minister Denies He Opposed College for Japanese Women,"After several days of controversy that has embarrassed the governing Liberal Democratic Party, Japan's Finance Minister has denied saying that the growing number of women seeking higher education are responsible for the sudden decline in Japan's birth rate. The Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is considered a strong candidate to become Prime Minister in coming years, was quoted in the Japanese press and by some of his own colleagues as suggesting at a Cabinet meeting last Tuesday that Japan should rethink its policies of promoting college education for women. In a letter on Saturday, Mr. Hashimoto said, ''It was distressing and damaging for me to be accused of having made a statement I had not actually made.'' But his letter left many questions unanswered and seemed unlikely to quell what Mr. Hashimoto himself termed a ''strong fury among Japanese women.'' A Raw Nerve The reports of his comments have struck a raw nerve for an increasingly assertive population of young Japanese, particularly women. Awareness of women's issues has grown significantly since last year, when the votes of women proved decisive in ending the Liberal Democrats' control of the upper house of Parliament. Nonetheless, the reaction to Mr. Hashimoto's remarks clearly took the ruling party by surprise, and its leaders have spent much of the last few days furiously backtracking. ''It has become an issue,'' said Kuniko Inoguchi, a professor of political science at Sophia University, ''because the declining birth rate really reflects the fact that the Government's policies have failed to provide young Japanese couples with better amenities in life, like bigger and more affordable housing. ''We don't want politicians looking for other causes, or suggesting that the problem is the fault of women,'' Professor Inoguchi said. ''People want an honest recognition that the country's policies are hostile to young couples that want to have bigger families.'' Sharp Decline in Birth Rate Japan's birth rate has fallen precipitously in recent years. A Government study released several weeks ago said the average number of children that a woman in Japan could expect to have in her lifetime dropped to 1.57 in 1989. In 1965, the figure was 2.14. In the last few years the decline has accelerated, stirring concern among Government and business leaders. Japan already suffers from an acute labor shortage: economists are questioning whether the labor force will be large enough to sustain planned economic expansion in the early 1990's. Few politicians are willing to call for a sharp increase in the birth rate, in part because such a move would be reminiscent of Japanese policy before and during World War II, when the Government urged women to reproduce as quickly as possible to preserve the Japanese empire. Jun Shiozaki, the Minister of Japan's Management and Coordination Agency, told reporters after the Cabinet meeting last Tuesday that Mr. Hashimoto had urged the Education and Labor Ministries ''to examine the relationship between higher education for women and the birth rate.'' Confused Accounts Japanese newspapers went further, quoting Mr. Hashimoto as saying that higher education is ''contributing to lowering the birth rate.'' The reports suggested he had left the strong implication that Japan should rethink its policy of encouraging young women to go to college rather than marrying and beginning families early. Another senior Government official who attended the meeting gave a nearly identical account of Mr. Hashimoto's comments. By late Wednesday Mr. Shiozaki had changed his account, saying that Mr. Hashimoto had said nothing about the birth rate but rather had requested a ''comprehensive study on the relationship between higher education and its impact on employment in general.'' In his letter, Mr. Hashimoto said the decline in Japan's birth rate ''is usually explained by a change in attitude toward marriage; the physical, psychological and economic cost of raising children; and the housing problem.'' Father of Five Mr. Hashimoto is the father of two boys and three girls, a very large family by Japanese standards. He noted in his letter that his wife and one of his daughters are college graduates. ''Against this background,'' he wrote, ''the real meaning of my statement was that, in view of the decline in the birth rate and the acute labor shortage in Japan - as well as the increase in the ratio of people seeking higher education regardless of their sex - it was time for the Government, especially the Ministries of Education and Labor, to review its policies regarding higher education.'' Professor Inoguchi said the election results last summer marked ''a sort of a threshhold'' for awareness of women's issues. ''The society has become much more sensitive to comments tinged with sexism.''"NYT,1991,India,Asia,"BYLINE: By SARA SULERI; Sara Suleri, the author of ''Meatless Days,'' is currently working on a book called ''The Rhetoric of English India.''","MAY YOU BE THE MOTHER OF A HUNDRED SONS A Journey Among the Women of India. By Elisabeth Bumiller. Illustrated. 306 pp. New York: Random House. $19.95. Elisabeth Bumiller has turned to the highly vexed subject of the status of women in contemporary India with great precision and clarity. ''May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons'' does not deal with third-world feminist theory, but instead aims to present an almost cinematic montage of the writer's engagement in the social reality of a cross section of Indian women and the cultural problems that they exemplify. The book is arranged as a compendium of interviews with an assortment of women, each of whom represents both ''social issue'' and ''person'' at the same time. Ms. Bumiller, who has been a reporter for The Washington Post, was in India from the beginning of 1985 to August 1988. She is engaged by personality, so the issues her subjects evoke are not subjugated to the rigors of an analytic framework. Rather, they are allowed their own freedom of association, and draw a redoubled attention to the author's artful invocation of the metaphor of journey. Given the infamous history of the innumerable narratives of their travels on the Indian subcontinent that Western writers have published from the 18th century to the present day, Ms. Bumiller attempts to recast the genre of journey into a statement that passes from cultural ignorance into a tentative reformulation of what a stranger may grasp. Such a comprehension is the ordering principle of her narrative: ''I have arranged the issues more or less in the order in which I encountered and understood them.'' This device is both the strength and the weakness of the book, for it licenses a productive juxtaposition of diverse issues while leaving bewildering transitions between the cultural conundrums that Ms. Bumiller attempts to address. Here, the author's candor deserves special commendation. Rather than attempting to construct a hierarchy of what may be of particular significance as feminist issues in India, Ms. Bumiller explores the status of women there without preconception. Her 12 chapters function as discrete essays; they range widely, including issues such as suttee, the ritual burning of a widow on her husband's funeral pyre, and bride burning, the ''grimly expedient'' death of young women in the early years of arranged marriages. She goes from female infanticide to Indira Gandhi, and then from population control to a rather charmingly appreciative essay on the torrid lives of Bombay film actresses. Despite its disparate structure, however, the book arrives at a cautionary conclusion: ''In the end, the country's three biggest challenges - maintaining democracy, secularism and national unity - cannot be accomplished without justice, including justice for women. . . . One reason to believe there is hope lies in India's resilience and spirit, but most of all in the strength of its women.'' Such a well-rounded conclusion, of course, is called into question by what precedes it, reporting that is not exactly emphatic about what ''justice'' may imply in contemporary India. In Ms. Bumiller's examination of two sensational cases of bride-burning and of suttee, her reportage is based upon an ''I was there'' rhetoric that somehow evades a more lasting analysis, and her assessment of the two situations, she says, ''was based on instinct, not evidence.'' The very difficulty of the cases she presents, however, should cause a reader to question whether intuition can actually substitute for knowledge. However admirable the writer's immediate engagement in issues that are strange and new to her, there is a disappointing inattention to the facts or the history - the pains of which constitute the heart of such a novel as ''The Satanic Verses'' - that dictate the troubles of India today. Where ''May You Be the Mother of a Hundred Sons'' remains most suggestive, however, is at those moments when it looks at feminist issues in the subcontinent in order to contrast them with the feminism and feminist issues of the West. Perhaps the most probing example is raised in the chapter called ''No More Little Girls: Female Infanticide Among the Poor of Tamil Nadu and Sex-Selective Abortion Among the Rich of Bombay.'' Here, the ethics of abortion are explored with a complicating power that does not merely pertain to the largest and most poverty-stricken democratic nation in the world today, but clearly engages the problems that ''choice'' poses to a postcolonial world. If Elisabeth Bumiller does not try to present coherent unities but instead travels from conversation into conversation, she has still accomplished what few other journalist travelers have achieved: she sought out a subject, and describes it modestly. The documentary generosity of her work deserves praise. Both the introductory and concluding chapters acknowledge the charm of curiosity and of engagement: ''India seems part of another time,'' the concluding chapter states, ''as if it were a dream that I had before awakening one morning.'' Her book, with its modesty and acuity, will be read as an elegant and unpredictable vision of what India continues to signify to the Western imagination."NYT,1991,Hong Kong,Asia,HONG KONG CAMPS TERMED INHUMAN,"An American refugee monitoring group said today that conditions in Hong Kong's closed detention camps for Vietnamese, where more than 44,000 men, women and children are imprisoned, were ''inhuman.'' ''These people are warehoused, stacked in living quarters that are totally inhuman,'' said one member of the delegation of the Women's Commission on Refugee Women and Children, which has visited five centers here that are closed to the press and most relief agencies, In a statement, the group said people in the camps were ''packed like sardines in concentration camp-like conditions.'' The group cited a host of problems inside, from sexual harassment of Vietnamese women by the guards to overflowing sewers and scanty medical care. Mothers and Babies Separated Liv Ullman, the actress, who works with Unicef and is a co-chairwoman of the visiting delegation, said that newborn babies in the camps have been accidently separated from their mothers and that close relatives have been sent to different camps. Patricia Derian, the other co-chairwoman of the group and a former United States Assistant Secretary of State for Humanitarian Affairs, said the Hong Kong government should open the camps to the press ''because when you see high barbed wire fences people need to know what goes on behind them.'' The group also called on Hong Kong to declare a one-year moratorium on the forcible repatriation of Vietnamese who arrive here, pointing out that more than 1,200 Vietnamese who have volunteered to return home are still waiting in the camps. On Wednesday, 123 more volunteers returned to Vietnam, bringing the total of returning volunteers to 995 since the program began last March. Officials of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that another group of volunteers will take off for Hanoi next week and that the voluntary program now appears to be gaining popularity. #51 Are Flown Home The British colony, which has been swamped by tens of thousands of Vietnamese asylum-seekers in the last year and a half, began forcing boat people to return home last month, sending 51 aboard a chartered flight to Hanoi. Of the more than 56,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong, only about 12,000 are considered refugees awaiting resettlement in a third country. Unless the Vietnamese in the detention centers can prove they are fleeing persecution, Hong Kong officials have said they will be forcibly returned. A spokesman for the Hong Kong government, which has often conceded that the camps are squalid because they are overcrowded, said that while the government had not yet reviewed the delegation's specific charges, members of the group have been meeting with key officials ''so we are talking with them and listening to their comments.''"NYT,1991,United Kingdom,West,LONDON JOURNAL; New Name and New Age (Is There a New Party?),"A cartoon in The Guardian recently depicted two women reading a sign that said, ''Communist Party of Great Britain - General Secretary Nina Temple.'' ''Typical,'' one woman said with a grimace. ''Women always get the lousy jobs.'' Given the current state of the British Communist Party, the sentiment might appear to have some merit. Dismissed by politicians and academics as politically irrelevant, the party fielded 17 candidates for Parliament in the general election of 1987 and won only 6,000 votes, or two-hundredths of 1 percent of all votes cast. Its membership has plummeted from a postwar high of 56,000 to 7,500, most of that decline over the last decade. Only two Communists have ever been elected to the House of Commons, the last one about 40 years ago. The party, founded in 1920, has nowhere near the strength of its Continental counterparts, which themselves are riven by dissent and far weaker than they were 15 years ago. First Woman as Leader But Ms. Temple - who last month was elected as the first woman and, at 33, the youngest leader of Britain's Communist Party - says she hopes to turn the party upside down, shake off its tattered image and apply such a fresh face that British Communism may appear nearly unrecognizable. The party is currently involved in a free-for-all debate over options for its future, which include ceasing to exist and changing into a distinctive element in a loose left-wing alliance. ''It's going to be such a thorough overhaul that we might not be the Communist Party anymore,'' Ms. Temple, articulate, relaxed and friendly, said in an interview at the party's comfortably frayed headquarters behind the busy meat district in East London. ''We do think Eastern Europe has big implications for us. We were founded as a Leninist party after the Russian Revolution. If we are arguing that the era of 1917 failed and that that is over, it seems right to look at ourselves and look at what it is we still maintain from that approach and what should go so that we can be part of the contribution to new progressive politics in Britain.'' Husband a Travel Agent If nothing else, Ms. Temple will no doubt help to dispel what she says is the popular image in Britain of a Communist, ''an 80-year-old Leonid Brezhnev.'' She was introduced to leftist politics by her parents and became a member of the Communist Party when she was 13 years old. She lives with her 1-year-old son and 3-year-old daughter, and the children's father, a schoolteacher. Ms. Temple's father operates a travel agency that advertises summer vacations to Siberia and Cuba, as well as Russian language courses and ecology programs. She says it was her participation in London protests against the Vietnam War that led her to a commitment to Communism. For Decades a Maverick Communist parties throughout Western Europe are searching for ways to be politically relevant without turning their backs on their principles, as they struggle to survive the collapse of traditional Communist governments in Eastern Europe. But unlike some pro-Soviet parties, the British Communist Party has for decades been a maverick and has distanced itself from governments in the East. Hard-line Stalinists have even accused it of being anti-Soviet and a so-called class traitor, leading to major splits in the party in the past. Over the years, it has opposed Moscow on a string of issues, including the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 and the war in Afghanistan, as well as criticized the British labor movement for policies like those that discriminated against blacks and women. Nonetheless, Ms. Temple said, the public continued to identify British Communists with Eastern-bloc governments. Also contributing to the party's weakness was the decline of mining and other heavy industries where its influence was traditionally based and an overwhelmingly white and male membership that, in the view of Ms. Temple and others, failed to quickly grasp changing times. 'Lost Time in 60's and 70's ''We lost a lot of time in the 60's and 70's,'' said Ms. Temple, who has a degree in material science, the study of things like plastics, metals and alloys, from Imperial College in London, but she has made the Communist Party her career. ''The party didn't see the way in which class was becoming much more diverse and the importance of women working, the role blacks were playing in transport and health services and the way people in the their working class today had different working experiences. It was a failure to keep right on the pulse of the working class. It left us mouthing slogans that didn't connect with people.'' The new General Secretary says the party's influence is limited to its magazine, Marxism Today, the most striking example of the new thinking within the British left as it struggles to formulate a popular alternative to the free-market policies of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The magazine's standing is such that leading journalists from The Economist and The Financial Times write for it without payment, and its rigorous analysis of economic and social issues is read with respect by many of the intellectual torchbearers of Thatcherism. 'A Very Utopian View' But as the party sets out to reinvent itself, Ms. Temple says she hopes that its influence will eventually be forceful enough to transform the landscape of the British left. ''My own definition of Communism is a very utopian view of how the world might be without class, racial or sexual prejudice, with respect for the natural environment and people living at a sustainable level within an egalitarian society,'' said Ms. Temple, who will earn about $12,000 a year in her new job. ''I don't expect to live in a society like that, but the importance of having those ideals is how they affect your practice and politics. Your daily practice determines your political end. As a Communist, in my daily practice I have to try to empower people, to open up politics that involve people. There is a connection between what I want to see in the long term and how I work today.''"
